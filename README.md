# MetalImage
Metal is a better way for using GPU to process images and videos in iOS.
So I try my best to do some intresting algorithms with this.
I had completed some simple works and demos for how to using it in image and video fields.I try make this frame work is similar to famous framework "GPUImage".So if you are familar to GPUImage , you will find it is very easy to use in Metal. And some thankfulness for Brad Larson, beacause he gave me some tips ever.
Today,I decided to share my works with a memorable date of birth of my daughter,and I will update this library in future.

Some future plans for this library:
1.Some 3D interfaces will be added for easy using metal draw CG effects.
2.Some face detections interface will be provided with this library, maybe need some days.
3.Some optimizations will be updated.

So I hope some guys can work with me together, and thanks for you...
